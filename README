This project wants to be to Rake what Autocmd is to Make.

Have a look at the self-explaining examples directory.

The script mkrf_conf will build a file .configure that contains
the whole configuration information. The Rakefile will read it in
by extending itself. Various #defines will be given in autoconf
style.
