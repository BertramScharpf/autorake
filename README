Autorake

This is a small extension to the original Rake by Jim Weirich.

Have a look at the self-explaining example directory.
Start off with "example/mkrf_conf".

The script mkrf_conf will build a file .configure that contains the
whole configuration information. The Rakefile will read it in by
extending itself with Rake::Configure. Various #defines will be
given in autoconf style.
